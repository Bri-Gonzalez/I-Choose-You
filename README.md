# Project Overview

## Project Name

I Choose You

## Project Description

This app will allow a user to choose their starter Pokemon so they can begin their journey as a trainer.
The user will select one of 3 pokeballs. The Pokeballs will be labeled by type: grass, fire, and water. Once the user selects the type they want for their starter Pokemon, the app will output a random Pokemon of that type.

add description of wireframe

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Use the PokeAPI to return the names and sprites of different Pokemon
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to select a Pokeball button by element type (Fire, Grass or Water), and then get back a Pokemon name and sprite for the element type selected

#### PostMVP  

- Create a Home page where user chooses to "Select their starter Pokemon" or "Catch Pokemon"
- Add a "Catch Pokemon" page:
* User will click a button to get back randomly generated Pokemon
* User will be able to decide whether to "catch" the Pokemon or "let it free"
* Save the caught Pokemon

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|July 10-12| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|July 13| Project Approval | Incomplete
|July 13| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|July 14| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|July 15| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|July 16| MVP | Incomplete
|July 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
